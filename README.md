languify
========
- Global languages as easy as Font Awesome
- Making your HTML pages readable for everyone on the web


## Getting started
- Load the css file for the desired language onto your page
- Write languified words by using `<span>` tags with special classes
- Documentation for special classes found in `/index.html` 
- Yes, it's just like font awesome!
- Fun tip for developers: 
    - Let end-users dynamically switch languages to whatever they like
    - Simply use javascript events to swap out the loaded css file with another


## Contributions needed
- Help build up the .css language libraries
- Correct mistyped words or contextually wrong words
- Documenting Languify on this README.md or the index.html
- Spreading the word and have more people use this!
